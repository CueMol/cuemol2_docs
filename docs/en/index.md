## CueMol



**CueMol** is a computer program for the macromolecular structure visualization (CueMol was formerly called "Que").
CueMol's aims are to visualize and create the publication-quality images of the macromolecular structures with user-friendly interfaces. You can find sample images created by CueMol in [Gallery](./en/Gallery) page. 
Currently supported files are molecular coordinates (PDB format),
electron density (CCP4, CNS , and MTZ formats),
MSMS surface data,
and APBS electrostatic potential map (OpenDX format). 

Powered by [Mozilla XULRunner](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla-based.html), the application framework of Firefox and Thunderbird (and other mozilla-based application as well), CueMol2 now runs under both Windows, MacOS X, and Linux in a similar GUI appearance.

### Main functions

*  Advanced GUI:
    *  Tab-based molecular views
    *  Support for multi-molecular scenes
    *  Copy&paste of objects (across different scenes)
    *  Support for the complete undo/redo operations (with respect to each scene)

*  Supported data formats:
    *  Molecular coordinates in PDB
    *  Electron density map in X-PLOR/CNS (ascii), CCP4 MTZ and MAP formats
    *  Molecular surface (MSMS format)
    *  APBS electrostatic potential map (OpenDX format)

*  Store and restore of the scene in XML-based format

*  Supported display:
    *  Basic molecular display functions (ball-and-stick model, CPK model, etc)
    *  Cartoon model display with tunable interpolation smoothness
    *  Edge rendering (with more tunable parameters than PyMOL's one)
    *  Solvent-excluded molecular surface (including the generation of the cross-section)
    *  Electron density rendering using GPU shader (mesh and volume rendering)
    *  Geometric object (solid/dashed lines)

*  Animation functions:
    *  Simple spin
    *  Camera motion
    *  Display fade in/out
    *  Structure morphing

*  Inter-operation with external programs
    *  Electrostatic potential calculation using APBS and PDB2PQR
    *  Rendering using POV-Ray
    *  Movie creation using FFmpeg
