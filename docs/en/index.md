## CueMol



**CueMol** is a computer program for the macromolecular structure visualization (CueMol was formerly called "Que").
CueMol's aims are to visualize and create the publication-quality images of the macromolecular structures with user-friendly interfaces. You can find sample images created by CueMol in [Gallery](../../en/Gallery) page. 
Currently supported files are molecular coordinates (PDB format),
electron density (CCP4, CNS , and MTZ formats),
MSMS surface data,
and APBS electrostatic potential map (OpenDX format). 

Powered by [Mozilla XULRunner](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla-based.html), the application framework of Firefox and Thunderbird (and other mozilla-based application as well), CueMol2 now runs under both Windows, MacOS X, and Linux in a similar GUI appearance.
