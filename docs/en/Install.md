## Windows version
### Installation from a binary distribution
If you haven't downloaded it yet, go to [Download](../../en/Download) page.

Execute the downloaded installer file(cuemol2-X.X.X.X-win32-setup.exe; where X.X.X.X is a version number).
Installer wizard will launch, so please follow the instructions.
If there is an older version of CueMol2 installed,
the older version will be overwritten.
(Or you can remove the older version from **Control panel** beforehand.)

The previous version (cuemol1) is regarded as a different application by the installer,
therefore you can install and use both versions.

**Caution:**<br />
Preferences (positions of palette windows, etc...) will be initialized,
by uninstalling an existing previous version before the installation.
