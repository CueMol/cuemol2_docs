## Loading PyMOL Session Files

CueMol can load PyMOL session files (pse files) for users migrating from PyMOL.

Execute menu "File" â†’ "Open scene..." to display the Open scene dialog, select PyMOL Session (**.pse) from the file format options, and open the file to load the pse file.

### Support Status

In the current implementation (2.2.1.349), the following features are implemented to load correctly:

*  Molecular coordinates and colors<br/>
However, regarding colors, information is lost when the loaded pse is saved as qsc

*  Sticks representation
*  Spheres representation
*  Cartoon representation
*  Lines representation
*  Surface representation
*  Labels (however, position offsets are ignored)

We plan to gradually expand supported features in the future.
