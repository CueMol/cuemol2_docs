## Exporting in POV Format
You can export to a format for loading and rendering in POV-Ray.
You can do this the same way as the [PNG case](../ImageExport), but set the export file format to POV-Ray.

After exporting, in addition to the pov file, inc files are also generated in the same directory.
This is the same as in the case of CueMol1.1.

On Windows, if POV-Ray is installed, you can double-click the exported pov file to launch POV-Ray and perform rendering.

The content of the exported files is also mostly the same as in CueMol1.1, but there are some differences. (Detailed explanations will be created in the future.)
Please also refer to the CueMol1.1 case [POVRay1](../../POVRay1).
